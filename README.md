# Notebook Collection by @asleekgeek

This repository is a curated collection of Jupyter Notebooks focused on practical AI, NLP, and prompt engineering tasks I've managed to collect from excercises from various courses and online sources.. Each notebook demonstrates a specific concept, workflow, or experiment, organized by topic and toolset.
